    ! Interpolating in all columns of input files can slow down computations 
    ! By default METISSE only interpolates in the essential columns 
    ! and the additional columns specified in the format_file.
    ! Using fewer columns means fewer calculations, therefore faster runs.
    ! If read_all_columns is true then all columns are used.

    ! NOTE that for binary evolution calculations, ONLY default columns are used,
    ! irrespective of whether read_all_columns is true or not.
    ! Quantities interpolated using any other columns are currently discarded.


    ! Extra columns to be used for interpolation if read_all_columns is false 
    ! Useful only for single-star evolution calculations with implicit mass loss.
