# METISSE_binary

**METISSE** (**MET**hod of **I**nterpolation for **S**ingle **S**tar **E**volution) is a code-package for evolving large number of stars by interpolating within a set of pre-computed evolutionary tracks from 1D stellar structure and evolution codes like MESA. The input tracks should be in EEP format, i.e. significant evolutionary points like zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) should occur at same line number across each file. 


Further details including code capabilties are described in: [Agrawal et al 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13177) and [Agrawal et al 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10187).
